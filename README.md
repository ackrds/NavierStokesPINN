# NavierStokesPINN

Physics Informed Neural Network solution of 2D Navier Stokes equations.
The implementation is in PyTorch. The code is a bit messy as I am still updating the file format.
Check this page regularly for future updates.
The data I am using is sourced from Maziar Raissi and his group. 'https://o365coloradoedu-my.sharepoint.com/personal/mara4513_colorado_edu/_layouts/15/onedrive.aspx?id=%2Fpersonal%2Fmara4513%5Fcolorado%5Fedu%2FDocuments%2FG%2FHFM&ga=1'
Use this link to access the data and download any 2D dataset you want. The data is quite big so I would suggest using Google Collab. I will upload a 3D version once its training is over.
